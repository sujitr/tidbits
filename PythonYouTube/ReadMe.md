# Python YouTube Download Script

This script uses [pytube](https://python-pytube.readthedocs.io) library. Please make sure its installed in your system before using this script.

As of now this script reads YouTube video URL's from a txt file 'videodownloadlist.txt', one URL per line. It's by default has one video - Year in Search 2011: Year In Review from Google. The most eventful year for me, so far.

Destination folder needs
to be specified in the script for downloaded videos.
