/**
 * QuickSort implementation.
 * Pivot element selected to be the first element.
 *
 * QuickSort has two steps in the algo -
 * 1. Partition - Find the correct sorted position of the
 *                selected pivot element and move elements smaller
 *                than pivot element to left of it and elements larger
 *                than pivot element to right of it.
 *                After that it also places the pivot element to that
 *                position.
 *
 * 2. Recursion - After first step, we would have two sub sets adjacent
 *                to both side of the actual pivot element in middle.
 *                So we call the partition step again for both of them
 *                recursively.
