/**
 * Say you have an array for which the ith element is the
 * price of a given stock on day i.
 *
 * If you were only permitted to complete at most one
 * transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of
 * the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
 *
 * Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.
 *
 *
 * We need to find out the maximum difference
 * (which will be the maximum profit) between two numbers
 * in the given array. Also, the second number (selling price)
 * must be larger than the first one (buying price).
 *
 * In formal terms, we need to find max(prices[j]âˆ’prices[i]),
 * for every i and j such that j>i.
 *
 * Brute Force Approach:
 * Time complexity : O(n^2)
 * Space complexity : O(1)
