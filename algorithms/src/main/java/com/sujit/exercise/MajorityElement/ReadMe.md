# Majority Element
Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element **always exist** in the array.

>Example 1:
>
>Input: [3,2,3]   
Output: 3

>Example 2:
>
>Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]   
>Output: 2

### 1. Brute Force Approach - with Hashtable
Simple hashtable based counting

### 2. Sorting Approach
Sort the array.   
The majority element is the n/2'th element in the array

### 3. Moore Voting Algorithm Approach
> This algorithm is applicable here as its given that
> there will always be a major element in the input array.

### 4. Fastest Approach
