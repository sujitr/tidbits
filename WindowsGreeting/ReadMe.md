Windows greeting message upon bootup
======================================

This is a simple VBS which when placed in the startup folder speaks out a greeting message 
depending upon the time of the day and if internet is available then queries the local weather (configured of Bangalore in the code)
and speaks out the same too.

## Points of improvement - 
1. Make the announcements more random in the way of addressing
2. ~~More definitive error handling scenarios when it comes to connecting the internet for weather api call~~
